Google BigQuery Python Samples
===============================================================================

This directory contains samples for Google BigQuery. `Google BigQuery`_ is Google's fully managed, petabyte scale, low cost analytics data warehouse. BigQuery is NoOps—there is no infrastructure to manage and you don't need a database administrator—so you can focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights, use familiar SQL, and take advantage of our pay-as-you-go model.

Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Authentication
++++++++++++++

Authentication is typically done through `Application Default Credentials`_,
which means you do not have to change the code to authenticate as long as
your environment has credentials. You have a few options for setting up
authentication:

#. When running locally, use the `Google Cloud SDK`_

    .. code-block:: bash

        gcloud beta auth application-default login


#. When running on App Engine or Compute Engine, credentials are already
   set-up. However, you may need to configure your Compute Engine instance
   with `additional scopes`_.

#. You can create a `Service Account key file`_. This file can be used to
   authenticate to Google Cloud Platform services from any environment. To use
   the file, set the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable to
   the path to the key file, for example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account.json

.. _additional scopes: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/authentication#using
.. _Service Account key file: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount

Install Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++

#. Install `pip`_ and `virtualenv`_ if you do not already have them.

#. Create a virtualenv. Samples are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ virtualenv env
        $ source env/bin/activate

#. Install the dependencies needed to run the samples.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/
.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/

Label a dataset or table
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python labels.py

    usage: labels.py [-h] [--project_id PROJECT_ID] [--table_id TABLE_ID]
                     dataset_id label_key label_value
    
    Application to add or modify a label on a BigQuery dataset or table.
    
    positional arguments:
      dataset_id            BigQuery dataset ID.
      label_key             Key for new/modified label.
      label_value           Value for new/modified label.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --project_id PROJECT_ID
                            Google Cloud project ID. If not set, uses a default
                            value from the environment.
      --table_id TABLE_ID   BigQuery table ID. If present, a label is added to the
                            specified table instead of the dataset.
