# Getting started with Django on Google Container Engine

This repository is an example of how to run a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 
app on Google Container Engine. It uses the [Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1
.9/intro/tutorial01/) Polls application as the example app to deploy. From here on out, we refer to this app as
the 'polls' application.


# Tutorial
See our [Django on Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/python/django/container-engine) tutorial for instructions for setting up and deploying this sample application.
